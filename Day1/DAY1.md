Day 1 focus more on familiarization with Javascript and the tools that we can use to run Javascript.

A high level programming language that is a core of web applications. Can be used for both client-side and server-side development.

## Running Javascript

### 1. Browser Developer Tools

- Open a modern web browser (I prefer Firefox).

- Click on the console tab.
- In the console, you can type Javascript code and it will evaluate once you hit Enter. You can try `console.log('Hello world!)`.
